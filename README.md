Hello, my name is Giandomenico, but everyone calls me Giando, I am very curious and I love to experience new things.
Years ago I stumbled upon the product management job and I loved it because it fit my personality perfectly.
Since then, I have worked on different products, mainly SaaS, where I have tried to do my bit.
I am currently entering the world of cybersecurity, as I find it very interesting. 
This is my cybersecurity portfolio.
